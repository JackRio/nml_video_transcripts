This repository is for the course New Media Lab at Radboud University (2020-2021).  

The project is to build a wrapper for the teaching websites like YouTube, Khan Academy, Udemy, Mooc, etc to enrich the audio transcripts of the 
lecture. The aim of the project is to help students understand the topic they are learning much better and get some 
additional resources on the topic they are learning. The project enhacnes the topic by finding the relevant key words and providing resources on these keywords and also generating a summary of the transcript.
