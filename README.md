# nml_video_transcripts

This repository is for the course New Media Lab at Radboud University (2020-2021). 
The project is to build a wrapper for the teaching websites like Khan Academy to enrich the audio transcripts of the 
lecture. The aim of the project is to help students understand the topic they are learning much better and get some 
additional resources on the topic they are learning.
