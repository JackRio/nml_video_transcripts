- [Voiceover] Here we have a simple page,
00:02
just a picture and a heading.
00:04
My goal is to make this page fancy
00:07
by starting with the image and the text as hidden
00:10
and then animating them in, like a slideshow.
00:14
Let me start with hiding them using jQuery.
00:18
So we're going to find the picture
00:20
and then call jQuery's 'hide' method on it.
00:23
Ta-da! It's gone.
00:25
And then we will find the text
00:28
and call 'hide' on it.
00:30
Gone! We got a white page.
00:32
So now, let's show them.
00:35
So, show the picture first.
00:38
It's back.
00:39
And then we'll show the text next,
00:44
and it's back.
00:45
So, we're back to what we started with basically.
00:48
And what happens here
00:50
is that we hid them and showed them so quickly
00:54
that it just looks like they were there all along.
00:58
What we actually want is to show them slowly
01:02
by animating them.
01:04
jQuery gives us lots of ways to animate, thankfully.
01:08
One way is to pass a number
01:11
as the first parameter of the 'show' method.
01:14
That number tells jQuery how slowly
01:17
to animate the element being shown.
01:20
There we go, and it animates it
01:22
in the top-left getting bigger.
01:25
That's cool.
01:26
What if we want it to slide down from the top?
01:30
We can replace 'show' with 'slideDown'.
01:34
There we go.
01:36
Now, let's animate the text.
01:39
I'll call 'slideDown' again
01:41
and I'm going to make the duration a little longer
01:44
to make sure we can really see it.
01:46
There, nice and slow.
01:49
Okay.
01:50
This is pretty fancy already,
01:52
but let's go one step further.
01:55
What if we only wanted to fade in this text
01:58
after we knew that the image was fully shown?
02:01
Basically, instead of starting these animations
02:04
at the same time,
02:05
we want the text animation
02:07
to start only after the image animation has ended.
02:12
For that, we can pass a 'callback function'
02:14
as the second parameter of the 'slideDown' function.
02:18
jQuery will call that callback
02:20
when the animation is complete,
02:23
which is just what we want.
02:24
Let's try it out.
02:27
There we go.
02:29
Now let's go ahead and change this animation
02:33
to a new method, 'fadeIn'.
02:35
And we don't even have to specify a duration
02:38
because there's a default duration for all these animations.
02:40
There. Very nice.
02:43
So can you imagine how you might use this
02:45
to make a slideshow?
02:46
You actually get to try that out in a project pretty soon.
