Vaccines are needed to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and to protect persons who are at high risk for
complications. The mRNA-1273 vaccine is a lipid nanoparticle–encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes the prefusion
stabilized full-length spike protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that
causes Covid-19.

METHODS
This phase 3 randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 99 centers across the United States.
Persons at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection or its complications were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two
intramuscular injections of mRNA-1273 (100 μg) or placebo 28 days apart. The primary end point was prevention of
Covid-19 illness with onset at least 14 days after the second injection in participants who had not previously been
infected with SARS-CoV-2.

RESULTS

The trial enrolled 30,420 volunteers who were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either vaccine or
placebo (15,210 participants in each group). More than 96% of participants received both injections, and 2.2% had evidence
(serologic, virologic, or both) of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline. Symptomatic Covid-19 illness was confirmed in 185
participants in the placebo group (56.5 per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 48.7 to 65.3) and in 11
participants in the mRNA-1273 group (3.3 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 1.7 to 6.0); vaccine efficacy was 94.1%
(95% CI, 89.3 to 96.8%; P<0.001). Efficacy was similar across key secondary analyses, including assessment 14 days after
the first dose, analyses that included participants who had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline, and analyses
in participants 65 years of age or older. Severe Covid-19 occurred in 30 participants, with one fatality; all 30 were
in the placebo group. Moderate, transient reactogenicity after vaccination occurred more frequently in the mRNA-1273
group. Serious adverse events were rare, and the incidence was similar in the two groups.

CONCLUSIONS
The mRNA-1273 vaccine showed 94.1% efficacy at preventing Covid-19 illness, including severe disease. Aside from
transient local and systemic reactions, no safety concerns were identified. (Funded by the Biomedical Advanced Research
